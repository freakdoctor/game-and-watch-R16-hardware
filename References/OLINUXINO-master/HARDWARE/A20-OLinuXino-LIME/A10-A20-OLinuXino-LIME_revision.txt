IMPORTANT A10-OLINUXINO-LIME AND A20-OLINUXINO-LIME SHARE SAME HARDWARE LAYOUT.

THIS IS BECAUSE THE A10 AND A20 CHIPS ARE PIN-TO-PIN COMPATIBLE (DROP-IN REPLACEABLE).

ONLY THE MAIN CHIP PLACED IS DIFFERENT.

NOTICE THAT A20-OLINUXINO-LIME2 DESIGN IS DIFFERENT COMPARED TO A10-OLINUXINO-LIME AND A20-OLINUXINO-LIME!

Hardware revision G, notable changes
===========
1. R68 was changed back from 4.32k/1% to 4.99k/1% so VDD DDR3 is set to 1.5V instead of 1.35V, because A10 doesn't support 1.35V DDR3 power supply(according to the sunxi's comparison table!).

7. 33pF capacitors are now in 0402 package.
8. 49.9R 1% resistors (R80, R81, R82, R83) are now in 0402 package.
9. C187, C188 and C190 were tantalum but changed to 0805 (beter performance).
10. HDMI-CEC is now pulled up with 27K resistor and diode to 3.3V.
11. HDMI-HPD has serial resistor(R97) = 10K. R32 changed from 13k/0603 to 20k/0402.
12. D4 moved to top side (on the place of U20). U20 on the other side moved to the bottom (under PWR_JACK).
