LCD-DRIVER is a common LCD board used in Olimex displays that have one of these suffixes 
at the end of the product name: "-RTS", "-CTS", or "+" and suffix.

Displays without touchscreen, without "+" at the end of the product name, or with suffix "TS" 
use own driver boards, not LCD-DRIVER. Check the folders of these displays for schematics of 
the driver boards.

It is important to notice that depending on the size of the display and the type of touschreen 
used the LCD_DRIVER board would be configured dirrently. Refer to the labes in the schematic 
and also refer to the bill of materials in the hardware revision B folder (BOM) for the 
different configurations.
