17. C97 and C98 were changed from 10pF to 22pF/50V/5%/COG/C0603;
18. PWR_LED, CHGLED and LED1 were changed in package - smaller pads to avoid floating of the LEDs while soldering.
19. R40, R85, R108 were changed from 100k/0603 to 100k/1%/0603;
20. C102 was changed from 100nF/0402 to 220nF/0402. C200 was changed from 100nF/0402 to 100nF/0603;
