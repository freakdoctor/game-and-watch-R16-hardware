#Olimex A10-OLinuXino-MICRO hardware sources

## A10-OLinuXino-MICRO has no product page since the board was never comercially manufactured. The design was used as basis for A20-OLinuXino-MICRO since the A10 and A20 chips are pin-to-pin compatible (drop-in replaceable).

## A20-OLinuXino-MICRO AND A20-OLinuXino-MICRO SHARE SAME HARDWARE LAYOUT.
